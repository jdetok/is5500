# week 2 case study
Overview
For this case study, you will identify and investigate a real-world example of a large software development project that successfully implemented any variation of an Agile framework. You will be expected to conduct a case study on the organization, exploring any challenges they faced, steps the organization took to adopt the agile methodologies, and the impact that the framework had on the project's timeline, quality, and overall success (or failure).

Your case study should address the following areas:

Background of the technical project: You will need to provide an overview of the software development project, including objectives, scope, and initial development approach. Highlight any timelines or potential impacts due to failure that the organization was facing. Don't forget to also outline why you've chosen his particular organization
Challenges and lessons learned: Outline any of the difficulties that the development team was facing before adopting the agile methodologies such as scope creep, timeline slippage, or failed requirements
Agile transition: Provide a high-level overview of what steps the development team implemented to adopt and transition to an agile framework. Were there any tradeoffs? What was implemented? Discuss any of the agile framework outputs or artifacts, roles, and ceremonies that were adopted and how they contribute to better project management and collaboration within the organization
Outcomes: Was the transition successful? Analyze the impact of agile adoption on the project's success. Did it improve time to market or project quality? Did it have full stakeholder by in? Discuss any lessons learned during the adoption and highlight any potential failures.
Your case study should be well-structured, thoroughly researched, and professionally presented. You are expected to use credible sources to support your analysis, such as company reports, interviews, and industry publications. Be sure to cite all sources appropriately.

The goal of this assignment is for you to develop a deeper understanding of agile methodologies, and how they can be applied in real-world software development projects to address challenges and improve outcomes. 

Deliverable: Your case study should be 2-3 pages in length.
