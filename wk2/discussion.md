# week 2 discussion
Explain the key principles and benefits of agile software development, and how it differs from traditional software development approaches. Discuss the role of Scrum and other agile frameworks such as kanban in the software development process.

Some of the key principles of agile software development are high adaptability and flexibility to change, communication and collaboration between team members and customersand fast delivery times. Agile development teams spend less time writing extensive documentation and ensuring things are perfect than teams using more traditional approaches and more time developing new features that can be quickly delivered to the stakeholders. Scrum is an agile framework that works in planning periods and 'sprints' where developers work in (typically 2 week) periods to develop features from the product back log. Other frameworks like Kanban also enable agile software development through slightly different approaches. For example, teams using the Kanban framework, instead of working in sprints, work in a more continuious flow and utilize the Kanban board to manage and adapt to changes.

Discuss the challenges associated with planning and estimating software development projects. How can agile methodologies help developers and stakeholders address these challenges and adapt to changes in project requirements? Consider the balance between planning and flexibility in your response.

Software projects experience a number of changes through their lifecycle, which can make concrete upfront planning difficult. New business needs can easily upend previous architecture decisions and create large amounts of additional work. Teams working with an agile methodology can address many of these difficulties. Agile teams value very regular communication within the team and between the team and its customers. This regular communication should result in less "surprise" changes through the project's lifecycle, and the ongoing relationship with the customer should make coordination easier to manage new project requirements.

Analyze the human aspects of software engineering, such as the characteristics of software engineers, the psychology of software engineering, and team structures. How do these factors influence the success of a software development project?

Computer software, at its core, is the result of the labor or humans, so human characteristics are central in construction of software and the performance of a software team. The book mentions seven principles from Erasmus that outline the human characteristics of a "superprofessional" software engineer: an effective software engineer has a sense of individual responsibility, has an acute awareness of the need of team members/stakeholders/managers, is brutally honest but constructive, exhibits resiliene under pressure, has a heightened sense fairness, exhibits attention to detail but not an obsession with perfection, and is pragmatic. While there are no hard methods to creating a software team that works effectively together, there are human characteristics managers can look out for to ensure they are hiring engineers who will fit into the team's sense of trust and purpose.
