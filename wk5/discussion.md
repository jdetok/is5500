Inclusive and accessible design is a very important aspect of modern software engineering. It is incredibly important for developers, especially those without accessibiliity needs, to be aware of the importance of accessibile design techniques. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) layout a standard for designing web applications with accessibility in mind. Developers should follow WCAG guidelines to ensure users have access to accessibility features like screen readers, functionalities that help index pages, etc. Developers should also design their web pages to be compatible and accessible for all screen types/sizes. Following these guidelines makes web pages navigable, accessible and understandable for all users. This greatly increases user experience and customer satisfaction, especially for those with disabilities.
