The importance of software quality has become increasingly apparent as software systems are integrated into virtually every aspect of our daily lives. Ensuring high-quality software can have a significant impact on user experience, business KPIs, overall security, and data integrity. 
 

For this discussion, research and share some examples of successful and failed software systems. Uses these systems to analyze how software quality, or the lack of quality, can contribute to the success or failure of these projects. What specific aspects of software quality (e.g., functionality, reliability, security, maintainability) played critical roles in these cases?
 

What challenges do these software development teams face when ensuring software quality? What factors (e.g., time constraints, limited resources, complex requirements) can make it difficult to achieve high-quality software?
 

During your discussion, outline the potential consequences of overlooking software quality. How can inadequate quality assurance impact end-users, businesses, and the overall reputation of software companies?

There are as many software developemnt tools available now than there have ever been, and I believe that has left the quality of today's software in an interesting place. Languages like Python have greatly lowered the barrier for entry in learning to program, and LLMs provide the option for developers to completely offload learning process and end up with a working finished product. I bring this up to say that software quality isn't top of mind for many developers, but the decades of improvements that have gone into improving the security and efficiency of software tools mean it doesn't necessarily have to be top of mind for most developers. 

I think business and time contraints can lead to projects failing in any industry. Systems of quality take significant time and collaboration to complete; tight deadlines and corporate pressures are largely antithetical to those requirements. In reality, a software projects requires a balance between the talent and inspiration of the developers and the need to deliver the project on time. I'd expect a well planned project with a well defined idea of quality as its main priority to succeed before a project prioritizing profit/speed to release.

There are severe potential consequences to neglecting quality, included security, performance, user experience, accessibility, and more. A project should define its standard for quality early in the process and measure against that standard often.
