In the ever-evolving world of software development, striking a balance between flexibility and structure in requirements modeling can be quite challenging. On one hand, software engineers must accommodate changing requirements, new technologies, and emerging business needs. On the other hand, they must maintain a structured and well-defined model to ensure clear communication, effective planning, and efficient development.

For this week's discussion, share your thoughts on the trade-offs and strategies for managing the balance between flexibility and structure in real-world software development projects. Consider the following questions to guide your discussion:
What are the primary challenges faced by software engineers when trying to maintain a balance between flexibility and structure in requirements modeling?
How can software engineers effectively adapt to changing requirements while maintaining the integrity of their models?
What techniques, methodologies, or tools have you encountered or would recommend helping manage this balance throughout the software development lifecycle?
How can project stakeholders be involved in the process to ensure that changes are managed effectively, and their impact on the project is minimized?
